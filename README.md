This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

A first attempt to get custom semantic-ui less theme incorporated into an ejected `create-react-app`. Based on [this article](https://medium.com/webmonkeys/webpack-2-semantic-ui-theming-a216ddf60daf), with [this script](https://gist.github.com/DesignByOnyx/c5d6bc8440479d7213ac157135544954) incorporated to copy the `variables` and `overrides` into the custom theme folder.
